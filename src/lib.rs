#![warn(clippy::pedantic)]
//! An amateur computer graphics engine made in Rust.
//!
//! Provides an "art canvas" to work with drawings, a mini matrix library
//! with several 3D transformations, and a parser to read scripts.
//! This library is still a work in progress project. Be warn.
//!
//! # The prelude
//!
//! Importing each trait individually can become a chore, so the `prelude`
//! module is provided to allow you to import the main traits all at once.
//! For example:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use gartus::prelude::*;
//! ```
